# WELCOME TO MY SIMPLE BUT AWESOME FINAL PROJECT. 
I am glad you are taking a tour on this.

                  A START 
let me start by telling you that I conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem. 
In creating my  front-end application, I created a React front end to build a user-focused platform called "HER CODE EVENTS".
I continued to build on the agile development methodologies I’ve used throughout this course. These include
storing my project code in GitHub, managing my work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using 
the Git branch workflow and pull requests.


I  used everything you’ve learned to create a real-world client-side web-page application that I’ll be 
able to showcase to potential employers. This project  provided you with the best opportunity to demonstrate my problem-solving 
skills, which employers will want to observe. 

        LETS HOP INTO THE PROJECT (Description)
